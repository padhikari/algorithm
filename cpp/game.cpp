/*Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items: health potions, torches, and arrows.
Create an enum to identify the different types of items, and a fixed array to store the number of each item the
player is carrying (use built-in fixed arrays, not std::array). The player should start with 2 health potions,
 5 torches, and 10 arrows. Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player has
  in total. Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems().*/
